        <h1>Hello! I'm Logan </h1>
        <p> I use he/him and they/them pronouns. My goals for this class are to learn some fun language and programming skills, without getting too frustrated.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I enjoy being outdoors when I can. Hiking, biking, and kayaking are my favorite ways to be active, but I also enjoy gardening and bouldering. My research focuses on 
            the role that HCI plays in human-environment relationships and I especially enjoy operating in a More-than-Human-Centered RtD process.
