        <p>I'm Logan! My goals for ATLS 2200 - Web are to gain a basic understanding of programming for the Web
            and to become more familiar with the use of online applications/programs like ArcGIS. I'm a Landscape
            Architecture major and I'm also pursuing minors in Evolutionary Biology and Creative Technology! If I 
            wasn't doing this, I would probably be a gardener or I would just find a way to hike for a living.</p>
