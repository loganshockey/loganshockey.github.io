        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <p>I'm Logan. My goals for ATLS 2200 - Web are to gain a basic understanding of programming for the Web
            and to become more familiar with the use of <strong> online applications/programs like interactive ArcGIS maps.</strong></p> 
        <h2></h2>    
        <p>I'm a Landscape Architecture major and I'm also pursuing minors in Evolutionary Biology and Creative Technology! If I 
            wasn't doing this, I would probably be a gardener or I would just find a way to hike for a living. I use he/him and they/them pronouns.</p>
