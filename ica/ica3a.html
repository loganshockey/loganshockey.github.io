            <p>Dear Eileen,

                Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's Science faculty to study as part
                of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.
            </p>
        <h2>Starting Dates</h2>
            <p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us
                better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:

                <ul>
                    <l>First Semester: 9 September 2016</l>
                    <l>Second Semester: 15 January 2017</l>
                    <l>Third Semester: 2 May 2017</l>
                </ul>

                Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.

                You can find more information about important university dates on our website.
            </p>
        <h2>Subjects of Study</h2>
            <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility - as long as the Subjects
                fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person 
                we'd like to have on our team.
            </p>
